//:story in a very special way, because I started my computer engineering
//:study just now. I am 39 years old and I realize how much prejudice
//: against age I still need to overcome. So enjoy Hinadan. A game made by
//:**Masako Wakamiya** that deals with inclusion, victory and with a
//:beautiful message that for life, nothing is too late.
