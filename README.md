 # **Hinadan**

I am very interested in topics related to inclusion and I had the happy encounter with this wonderful story by Masako Wakamiya.  A game made by **Masako Wakamiya** that deals with inclusion, victory and with a beautiful message that for life, nothing is too late. I feel this story in a very special way, so enjoy Hinadan.
